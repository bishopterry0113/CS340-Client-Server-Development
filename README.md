•	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

When writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is to consider the reusability and compatibility of the code you write. The create, read, update, delete (CRUD) modules are the basic functionalities of any data table and I strongly believe will continue well into the future as these are easy to use. Additionally, writing testable code to help identify any errors in the solution could be used moving forward into the future. 

•	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

The first approach to understanding the problem is to understand the requirements that were provided. From these requirements depending on how big the requirement is, then it would be best to break down the problem into smaller steps. One of the approaches with Grazioso Salvare dashboard is to create a filter to help sort through all the data and place it onto a table. The strategy applied moving forward when creating the databases per the client requests is to understand the requirements and apply them in a manner that is to 3

•	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists analyze data to solve a real-world problem. This matters as these kinds of data can be from a medical standpoint and help save lives. In regarding to the project, Grazioso Salvare, help find water rescue, Mountain or wilderness rescue or Disaster or individual tracking helps them do their work better while at the same time provide a service to help save lives.
